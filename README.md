# GP_for_predicting_mag_mom

This is a work in progress. 

The code is written to predict a value (in my case, it is magnetic moment) based on a provided NN numbers (using the NN Circles code) using GP. 

First it is trained by X and Y values. X contains the NN numbers (it is array of numbers) and Y contains the specific value (in my case, magnetic moment).

Y_new will be predicted given X_new.
